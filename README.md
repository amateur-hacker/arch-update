# Arch-Update

`arch-update` is a simple and effective Bash script designed to update your Arch Linux system and its AUR packages with a user-friendly experience. It dynamically selects the best mirrors based on your country, ensuring faster updates.

## Features

- **Dynamic Mirror Selection**: Automatically determines your country and updates the mirror list for optimal download speeds.
- **System & AUR Updates**: Easily updates both system packages and AUR packages using `pacman` and `paru`.
- **Interactive & User-Friendly**: Prompts you before taking any action, ensuring you're in control of the process.
- **Error Handling & Color-Coded Messages**: Displays success, warning, and error messages in color, making it easier to follow the script's progress.

## Installation

To install `arch-update`, run the following command to download, make the script executable, and move it to `/usr/bin` for global access:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amateur-hacker/arch-update/main/arch-update\
&& chmod +x arch-update && sudo mv arch-update /usr/bin/arch-update
```

Once installed, you can run `arch-update` from anywhere on your system.

## Usage

```bash
./arch-update [OPTIONS]
```

### Options

- `-h, --help`: Show the help message and exit.

The script will guide you through the update process and prompt you for your confirmation before proceeding with any action.

## Script Flow

1. **Determines Your Country**: Uses your IP address to figure out your location and fetches the best mirror list for your region.
2. **Updates System Mirrors**: It then updates the list of mirrors to use the best and most reliable ones for your country.
3. **System Package Update**: The script checks if there are any available system updates and installs them using `pacman`.
4. **AUR Package Update**: If `paru` is installed, the script checks for and updates AUR packages.
5. **Completion**: Once the update process is complete, youâ€™ll receive a summary message.
